            I started learning programming when I was dealing with some data in
            my work. I tried to find the lazy way to automate the process
            perfectlyðŸ˜‚, and I finally do it with python. In the process, I find
            my self really enjoy coding and building program work exactly as
            designed.

            Afterward I started to learn web dev while building a web scraper,
            and it opens up a whole new world for me. I dive into web
            development from front-end to back-end, building fully functional
            application, and keep improving my skills everyday.

            As a sci-fi fans, I like watching sci-fi movies and playing video
            games, also interesting in other technical stuff. Of course,
            including programming.
